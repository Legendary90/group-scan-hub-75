# Complete Setup Instructions for Inventory Management System

## Overview
This is a complete inventory management system with client authentication, subscription management, and full admin control. The system is designed to be deployed once and managed entirely through the admin panel.

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup Guide

### 1. Database Setup (Supabase)

1. **Create a Supabase Project**
   - Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Create a new project
   - Wait for the project to be fully initialized

2. **Run the SQL Schema**
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to SQL Editor
   - Copy and paste the entire contents of `database_schema.sql`
   - Click "Run" to execute the schema

3. **Get Your Credentials**
   - Go to Settings > API
   - Copy your:
     - Project URL (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL`)
     - Anon/Public key (`VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`)

### 2. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in your project root:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 3. Install Dependencies and Build

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Start the development server (for testing)
npm run dev
```

### 4. Deploy the Application

Deploy the built application to your preferred hosting service:
- **Netlify**: Drag and drop the `dist` folder
- **Vercel**: Connect your repository
- **Traditional hosting**: Upload the `dist` folder contents

### Backend
- **Supabase** for database and authentication
- **Row Level Security** for data isolation
- **Automatic triggers** for subscription management
- **PostgreSQL** with custom functions

### Security Features
- **Client Data Isolation**: RLS ensures clients only see their data

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

### Database Management
- **One-Time Setup**: Database schema runs once, no further SQL needed
